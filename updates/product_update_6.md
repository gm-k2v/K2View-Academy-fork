- Added the **delta_recycle** command  that recycles transactions failed in the delta PARTITION mode and should be recycled to Kafka after deploying the fixed code.
- When iidFinder is in the delta PARTITION mode, priority instances are now handled in the same topic/job as other instances that are not in priority.
- Added an optimization mechanism to ensure a better balancing of jobs within a Fabric cluster.
- A new interface type was introduced for SSH.
- Added the ability to run the **get** command in parallel from different LU types and to be able to run a merged     query on the same session.
