### The TDM 7.6 Official Release

TDM 7.6  has just been released and it includes many exciting features:

* **TDM 7.6 is based on Fabric 7**.
* **Installation Improvements** - the addition of the TDM GUI code to the TDM library. The TDM installation no longer requires a separate package of Fabric with the TDM GUI code. The deployment of the TDM LU adds the TDM GUI web application to Fabric.
* **Reference Fixes and Enhancements** - Reference tables are now stored in a dedicated Fabric LU instead of Cassandra.
* The addition of **TDM Custom JMX Statistics** for a better monitoring of the TDM processes.
* **TDM GUI - Task Window** - the addition of a new checkbox to define whether the task needs to filter out reserved entities (reserved for other users) by the creation of the task's entity list.
* **Masking improvements** - a split of the masking's Global variable into 2 variables, extract and load.
* **Other Bug Fixes**.
