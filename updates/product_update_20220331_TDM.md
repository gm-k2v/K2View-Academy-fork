### The TDM 7.4 Official Release

We have just released TDM 7.4, which includes the following enhancements:

* **Entity Reservation Feature** - is made to enable a user to reserve (lock) entities in the testing environment and avoid other users from re-provisioning these entities into the testing environment until the user completes the functional tests and can release these entities.
* **TDM GUI Changes** - the **task windows have been redesigned** to enable a more intuitive and comprehensive creation or edit flow,  adding a new **Reserved Entities window**, and some additional enhancements.
* **Update the TDM APIs for Task Execution** - supporting overriding of Data Versioning (Data Flux) and entity reservation attributes.
* **Bug Fixes**
