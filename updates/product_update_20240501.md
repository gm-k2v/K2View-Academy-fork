### The Fabric 8.0 Official Release

Fabric 8.0 has just been released and it includes the following:

* Fabric can now use PostgreSQL as an LUI storage layer, which allows to support cross-instance queries for reporting and analytics.
* Fabric Catalog now supports parsing of text fields which include a complex structure (JSON or XML).
* Introducing K2exchange - a store-like platform for publishing and consuming Fabricâ€™s modules that are not part of the product and that are hence considered as extensions. 
* Additional features are supported in Broadway, e.g. Elseif conditions, Retry mechanism for an actor in a flow and various new actors.
* Fabric supports multi-DC architecture only an https connection between the DCs. 
  * For example: DC1 is on-prem, DC2 is on cloud, and in addition Fabric has access to the source database from one of the DCs only (e.g., on-prem).
