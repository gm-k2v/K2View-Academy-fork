### The Fabric 8.0 Official Release

Fabric 8.0 has just been released and it includes the following:

* Fabric can now use **PostgreSQL as an LUI storage layer**, to support cross-instance queries for reporting and analytics.
* The Catalog can now parse text fields with a **complex structure** (JSON or XML), profile them and identify PII elements within the complex structure.
* Introducing **K2exchange** - a store-like platform for publishing and consuming Fabricâ€™s modules that are not part of the product and that are hence considered as extensions. 
* New Broadway features: **Elseif** conditions, **Retry** mechanism for an actor in a flow and various new actors.
* Fabric can now support a **multi-DC architecture** only an HTTPS connection between the DCs. For example: DC1 is on-prem, DC2 is on cloud, and Fabric has an access to the source database from one of the DCs only (e.g., on-prem).
