# Schema Tables' Highlighting

When maintaining large logical units with many tables, it becomes difficult to understand and manage a complex schema. The Tables' Highlighting feature enables to highlight some of the tables and bring them into focus.



## Highlighting Connected Tables 

Highlighting connected tables helps you to better understand the connection and relations between tables, especially in large schemas, by highlighting related tables.



### Activate Highlighting

To activate the highlighting feature: 

1. First, select a table with connections to other tables that you wish to see. 

2. Choose to highlight by either:

   - Click on the schema's top bar **highlighting bulb** action icon ( ![](images/web/light-off.svg)). 

   - Open the table menu (ellipsis, 3 dot menu) and choose **Highlight by relation**

3. Select one of the following highlighting option types:

   - Only connected tables, All connected tables - predecessors and successors
   - Only predecessors
   - Only successors



Once chosen, all other tables become blurred. Additionally, the highlighting bulb icon in the schema' top bar turns orange, indicating that the highlighting feature is currently turned-on.
