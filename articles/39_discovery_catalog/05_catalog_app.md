# Catalog Application

### Overview

The Catalog is accessed from the [K2View Web Framework](/articles/30_web_framework/01_web_framework_overview.md) by selecting the **Catalog** application from the context menu. Upon opening, the application displays the data from *neo4j* Graph DB and allows navigation from one level to another through a data modelâ€™s graph, expanding and collapsing various elements (nodes), viewing node's properties, searching the node, and more.

The Catalog application includes the following parts, described in this article:

* [Main area](05_catalog_app.md#main-area), which displays the Catalog tree with its elements.
* [Menu bar](05_catalog_app.md#menu-bar), which allows to perform various activities. 
* [Properties tab](05_catalog_app.md#properties-tab), which displays the properties of the selected element.

### Main Area

The Catalog's main area enables navigation between the hierarchy levels, by expanding and collapsing various elements.

The initial view displays the Data Platform elements (data source interfaces defined in the Fabric project), for which the Discovery process has been performed.

The following activities can be performed using the context menu of the Catalog nodes:

* **Expand** <img src="images/expand.png" style="zoom:80%;" />or **collapse** <img src="images/collapse.png" style="zoom:80%;" /> the next level elements. 
  * For example, clicking the <img src="images/expand.png" style="zoom:80%;" /> icon of the Schema element expands all Data Sets under this Schema. 
  * A double-click on the selected entity can also expand or collapse it.
* **Hide** <img src="images/hide.png" style="zoom:80%;" /> the element from the window.
* **Focus** <img src="images/focus.png" style="zoom:80%;" /> is available on the Data Platform and the Schema nodes. 
  * Clicking Focus opens a new view, which includes all the elements of the level below. 
  * For example, when Focus is clicked on the Schema element, the view will display all Class elements under this Schema.

In case the Discovery process hasn't been executed on any project interface, the main area would be empty. 

### Menu Bar

The menu bar is a toolbar located at the top of the window. It includes the following choices:

* The **Actions** menu allows to:
  * **Edit** the catalog manually. Click [here](07_manual_overrides.md) for more details regarding the Manual Overrides.
  * Open the **Classifier Configuration** screen, to update the profiling rules. This screen is described further in this article. 
  * Unhide the hidden nodes. Selecting a node from this list returns it back to the view.
* **Search** the catalog. Click [here](08_search_catalog.md) for more details regarding the Catalog Search. 
* **Expand**, **collapse** and **hide**, triggering the same activities as in the element's context menu. Multiple element selection is supported.  
* **Layout selection** <img src="images/layout.png" style="zoom:80%;" />, enabling the Catalog layout. Horizontal (default), vertical or centered layout are supported.
* **Zoom in / out**, adjusting the zoom of the view.

### Properties Tab

The Properties Tab displays the properties of the selected element. Some of the properties are created by the Crawler and some are created by plugins. Clicking the property name or the <img src="images/info.png" style="zoom:80%;"/> icon next to the element name opens the More Info popup window, providing more details about the clicked property. 

Clicking on a property opens the More Info popup window that provides more details on the selected property.

### Classifier Configuration Window

The Classifier Configuration window allows to view and update the profiling rules invoked by the Catalog built-in plugins which are described [here](04_plugin_framework.md#built-in-plugins).

The following restrictions should be considered when updating the data via this window:

* The combination of Classification & Type must be unique.
  * For example, you can define Classification = EMAIL twice: with Type = Data and with Type = Metadata, but you cannot define it twice with the same type.
* The PII must be aligned for two entries with the same Classification.
  * For example, when defining two entries for Classification = EMAIL, the PII indicator of both of them should be either true or false.
