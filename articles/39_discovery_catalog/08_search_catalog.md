# Catalog Search

### Overview

The Catalog provides two types of search: regular and advanced. The search scope is **nodes**, on any level of the catalog hierarchy from data platform to fields and **links**. 

The search area in the menu bar allows to search a node name. The search is performed on the  catalog nodes of all hierarchy levels, in the version currently displayed in the Catalog application, even if the node is collapsed and doesn't appear on the screen.

The search is done using the ‘includes’ statement and the input values are case insensitive. 

### Advanced Search

The advanced search allows to narrow the search to a specific node type, for example - FIELDS only. 

It also provides an ability to search by PII and Classification properties. So, when marking PII = true in the advanced search, the results list will include all nodes marked as PII.

In addition, it is possible to search by a score. For example, when the user enters 0.5,  the results list will return all nodes and links with score lower than 0.5.

### Search Results

The search results are presented in a list, enabling the users to either view the entity in the Catalog tree by clicking the link or to export them into a CSV file.

The search results can be expanded to full screen.
