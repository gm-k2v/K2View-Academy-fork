# Catalog Search

The Catalog provides two types of search: regular and advanced. The search scope is **nodes**, on any level of the catalog hierarchy: from data platform to fields. The **links** are not included in the search scope. 

The search by input text is done using the ‘includes’ statement and the input values are case insensitive. The search is always performed in the displayed catalog version.

### Regular Search

The regular search allows to search by a node name. It can be done using the search area in the menu bar. The search is performed using the *search-as-you-type* field type. 

### Advanced Search

The advanced search provides an ability to search by PII and Classification properties. It also allows to narrow the search to a specific node type, for example - FIELDS only. 

### Search Results

The search results are presented in a table, enabling users to either add an entity to the displayed Catalog tree. The search results can be expanded to full screen and exported to a CSV file.
