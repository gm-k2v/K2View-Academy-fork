# Catalog Search

### Overview

The Catalog provides two types of search: regular and advanced. The search scope is **catalog entites**, on any hierarchy level from data platform to fields and relations. 

The search area in the menu bar allows to search by an entity name. The search is performed in the currently displayed catalog version, even if the node is collapsed and doesn't appear on the screen.

The search is done using the ‘includes’ statement and the input values are case insensitive. 

### Advanced Search

The advanced search allows to narrow the search to a specific object type, for example - FIELDS only. 

It also provides an ability to search by PII and Classification properties. So, when marking PII = true in the advanced search, the results list will include all nodes marked as PII.

In addition, it is possible to search by an object's score. For example, when the user enters 0.5,  the results list will return all nodes and relations with score lower than 0.5.

### Search Results

The search results are presented in a list, limited to 1000 rows. The search results can be expanded to full screen. You can either view the entity in the Catalog tree by clicking the link or export the search results into a CSV file.
