# Catalog Search

### Overview

The Catalog provides two types of search: regular and advanced. The search scope is the catalog objects (from data platform to fields and relations) of the currently displayed version. 

To start the search, click the ![](images/search.png)icon in the menu bar. It opens the search area which allows to search by an object name. The search is performed in the displayed catalog version, even if the node is collapsed and doesn't appear on the screen.

The search is done using the *includes* statement and the input values are case insensitive. 

### Advanced Search

The advanced search allows to narrow the search by specifying one of the following parameters:

* Search within the selected object type(s) only, for example - Fields and Relations only. 

* Search by PII and Classification properties. So, when marking PII = true in the advanced search, the results list will include all nodes marked as PII.

* Search by an object's score. For example, when the user enters 0.5,  the results list will return all nodes and relations with score lower than 0.5.

### Search Results

The search results are presented in a list which can be expanded to full screen. You can either view the entity in the Catalog tree by clicking the link or export the search results into a CSV file.

The returned result set is limited to 1000 rows.
