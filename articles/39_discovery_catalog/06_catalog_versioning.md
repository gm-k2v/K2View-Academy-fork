# Catalog Versioning

The Fabric's Catalog supports **versioning** which allows to identify changes in the data source by comparing between the versions. Any kind of change is discoverable, for example, addition of a field or change in a field's property value.

A new version is created in the *neo4j* Graph DB when the Discovery process runs and finds differences comparing to the last version. If the Discovery process doesn't identify any changes comparing to the previous catalog version, a new version is not created.

The Catalog application allows a user to view each catalog version as well as to analyze the differences between the versions, as described below.

**Version View**

Select a version from the list to get the full version view. 

* By default, the latest version is displayed.

* The coloring scheme of the standard view is blue.

* The user can switch between various catalog versions. 

**Version Comparison**

Compare two versions to analyze the changes. 

* To do so, click the compare <img src="images/compare.png" style="zoom:75%;" /> icon in the version's drop-down list. 
* The earlier version is compared to the later version and the differences are indicated using the colors, as follows:
  * New elements are green, removed elements are red, updated elements are blue.
  * When a property is updated, it is displayed twice â€“  the new value is green, the removed one is red.
  * All unchanged entities and relations are grey.

* To return to the regular view mode, select a version from the list.
