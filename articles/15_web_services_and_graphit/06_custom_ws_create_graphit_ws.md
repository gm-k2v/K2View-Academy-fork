# Create Custom-Built Web Service with Graphit

As a powerful low-code utility, Graphit enables web service planning and generation in a visualized layout, as well as inline testing capabilities. To learn more about Graphit utility - read [here](/articles/15_web_services_and_graphit/17_Graphit/01_graphit_overview.md).

A Graphit file is structured as a hierarchical representation of nodes, where each node defines an entry element in the structure of the JSON, XML or CSV document.

To create a new Graphit Web Service follow these steps:

1. Go to **Project Tree**, click on **Web Services** > **Graphit** > right-click & choose **New Graphit File**. 

    ![images](17_Graphit/images/new_graphit_file_studio_bigger.png)

    A Graphit file opens, containing a newly created Graphit node, which should be populated.

2. Start with choosing, from the drop-down list, any of the below commands/functions (node types): 

    ![](17_Graphit/images/commands_functions_node_types.png)

    Initiate the example by choosing a **get** command

    It is useful to place the **get** command - a function that retrieves the LUI (Logical Unit Instance) - in the beginning of the Graphit layout although it can be implemented on any of the nodes. 

3. From the open pop-up window, select an LU from the drop-down list and then click **Add**.

    Once this 1st node is created, it will looks like this:

    ![](17_Graphit/images/first_graphit_node.png)

    You can later change the **get** command, when needed, by clicking on the ![](17_Graphit/images/selection.png) icon, triggering the *Get Command Builder* pop-up window again.


4. Hover over the node and click on the plus icon ![](17_Graphit/images/add_sibling.png)in order to add a sibling node to the example layout.

5. Name the newly created node by populating the left-hand-field.
    Note that only nodes with a tag name are displayed in the output document, when a Graphit web service is called.

6. Choose an **sql** command, as the node type, using the drop-down arrow. ![](17_Graphit/images/populate_second_node.png)

7. Click on the query builder icon ![](17_Graphit/images/db-icon.png) on the 2nd node, to generate a query in a Query Builder window.
    Read [here](https://support.k2view.com/Academy/articles/11_query_builder/01_query_builder_overview.html) for more information about Query Builder.

    Following the creation of the 2nd node and its population, a message pops up, asking whether you want to create table fields, i.e. laying out and exposing the SQL fields in the Graphit; choose **YES**.

    The below image shows the **nested nodes layout result**: 
    
    ![](17_Graphit/images/new_graphit_example.png)
    
    Note that exposing the SQL fields is optional and even if you choose **NO**, the fields will be displayed in the output document. Yet, exposing them allows you to manipulate them. It is sometimes preferred by implementors for a better visualized output document, to see a full layout of the structure.

8. **Save** the Graphit file. A pop-up message will appear, asking you to assign a **Name** and a **Category** for your Graphit file.

    ![](17_Graphit/images/new_item_name_and_category.png)

    Once **Ok**'ed, the newly created Graphit file name appears in the **Project tree**, under its category, and automatically receives a '**.graphit**' **suffix**:

You can create a new web service either from the Fabric menu at the top menu bar or from the project tree.

When initiated from the Fabric menu:

1. Open **Fabric** Menu, choose **New Web Service**
2. Select **New Graphit Web Service**

When initiated from the project tree: 

1. Go to **Project Tree**, click on **Implementation** -> **Logical Units / Data Products** -> **Web Services**
2. Expand **Web Services** -> right-click on **Graphit** and choose **New Graphit**

3. Click on **Choose Category** to select an existing category name for the Graphit file:

![](17_Graphit/images/web_choose_category.png)

or click on **New Category** to enter a new category name, followed by *Enter* for saving it:

![](17_Graphit/images/web_enter_new_category.png)

The following step is to enter **a name** for your new Graphit file, followed by *Enter* for saving it. Note that the name should contain only alpha-numeric characters.

Using the file name, you can control and set both the web-service version and its verb. For more information - read [here](09_custom_ws_properties.md#Graphit). The popup itself provides some tips about the recommended naming conventions.

The Graphit file is saved, its name appears at the top of its layout, it is open and it contains a newly created Graphit node, which should be populated:

4. Start with choosing, from the drop-down list, any of the below commands/functions (node types):

5. From the open pop-up window, select an LU from the drop-down list and then click **Add**.

6. Hover over the node and click on the plus icon ![](17_Graphit/images/add_sibling.png)in order to add a sibling node to the example layout.

10. **Save** the Graphit file. 




It now appears in the **Project tree**, under its category, and automatically receives a '**.graphit**' **suffix**:

> NOTE: Prior to  Fabric 7, Graphit files were located only under Java/resources folder. This option is still available, for a backward compatibility.
