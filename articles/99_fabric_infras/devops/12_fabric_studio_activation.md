# Fabric Studio License Activation

Fabric License is managed remotely to control and monitor validations (to verify that number of installations and licenses' expiration dates). For this reason, an active Internet connection is required for an initial activation of the license.
for this process, in case Fabric Studio is installed on a server with no Internet access, an external station with Internet access should be used.

#### Prerequisites
License ID and Activation password (will be provided by View Account manager).

#### Online Activation
The simplest activation is as follows: 
* Select the 'Activate a license or renewal.' option under Actions/'I want to...'.

* Click 'Next'.
* Wait for the activation request to complete and then click 'Finish' to resume your work.
