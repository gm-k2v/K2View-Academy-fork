# Build Catalog Artifacts

The Catalog provides an ability to build the artifacts and save them into the project tree. The artifact is created in a CSV format file that includes the list of IDs of all catalog fields, their classification and PII properties, for the given catalog version. The CSV file is saved into the Discovery/MTable folder of the project tree. 

The artifact is created as an MTable that can be used by the masking mechanism in order to identify at run-time which fields are supposed to be masked.
