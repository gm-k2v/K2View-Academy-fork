# Catalog Versioning

The Catalog supports **versioning** - ability to create a new Catalog version in the  *neo4j* Graph DB every time when the Discovery process runs and finds differences comparing to the previous version.

Then, using the Catalog application a user can view each catalog version as well as analyze the differences between the versions, as described below.

Note that if the Discovery process doesn't identify any changes in the data source comparing to the previous catalog, a new version is not created.

### Version View

By default, the Catalog displays the latest version. To view one of the old versions, select a version number from the list: 

<img src="images/versions.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

The coloring scheme of the standard view is blue. 

### Version Comparison

To compare two versions, click the comparison <img src="images/compare.png" style="zoom:75%;" /> icon in the version's drop-down list. 

The differences between the two versions are indicated using the colors, as follows:
* The new elements are green, the removed elements are red, and the updated elements are blue.
* When a property is updated, it is displayed twice â€“  the new value is highlighted by green, the removed one is red.
* All unchanged entities and relations are grey.

To return to the regular view mode, select a version from the list.
