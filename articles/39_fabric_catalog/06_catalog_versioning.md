# Catalog Versioning

The Catalog supports **versioning** - ability to create a new Catalog version in the  *neo4j* Graph DB every time the Discovery process runs and finds differences when comparing with the previous version.

Then, using the Catalog application, a user can view each version separately or check the differences between 2 selected versions, as described below.

Note that if the Discovery process doesn't identify any changes in the data source or in the plugins settings, a new version is not created.

Additional trigger for a version creation is a manual editing of the Catalog. 

[Click here for more information about the manual overrides](07_manual_overrides.md).

### Version View

By default, the Catalog displays the latest version. To view any version, open the version's drop-down list and click a version number: 

<img src="images/versions.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

The Catalog tree is then displayed using the standard coloring scheme where all the nodes are blue and the relations are orange. 

### Version Comparison

To compare 2 versions, click the comparison <img src="images/compare.png" style="zoom:75%;" /> icon in the version's drop-down list. The Catalog tree is then displayed using the comparison coloring scheme, indicating the differences between the 2 versions, as follows:

* The new elements are green, the removed elements are red, and the updated elements are blue.
* When a property is updated, it is displayed twice â€“ the new value is highlighted in green whereas the removed one is in red.
* All unchanged entities and relations are grey.

When a Schema has too many Datasets, it might be hard to identify the differences. To view updated Datasets only, first expand the Datasets and then click the comparison icon in the Catalog's legend:

<img src="images/view_diff_only.png" style="zoom:67%;" />

To return to a regular view mode, open the version's drop-down list again and click a version number.
