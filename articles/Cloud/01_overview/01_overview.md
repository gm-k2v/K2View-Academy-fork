# What is K2cloud?

Adopting cloud technology is crucial, as it offers unparalleled agility, scalability, and business continuity. These characteristics align with the requirements of data-oriented platforms, where more and more data is gathered and processed.

K2cloud is a comprehensive orchestration platform that empowers users to effortlessly, with a click, generate, manage, and observe various Fabric runtime environments, including Training, Development with Web studio IDE, QA, CI/CD, Staging and Production. These Fabric runtime environments run in the Cloud, where K2cloud uses the most up-to-date cloud technology, Kubernetes-based, while encapsulating all cloud operation complexity from users.

The platform offers the flexibility to choose between a fully managed cloud service, a self-hosted environment (customer tenant or on-prem), or a hybrid setup, enabling seamless accessibility from any location.

## Key Objectives and Benefits

K2cloud platform offers advantages for a variety of teams, for different roles and from various aspects.

* **Improve Business Productivity**, focusing on the business logic implementation:
  * Spin up, with a click, the most suitable Fabric runtime environment for you.
  * Have a full development web framework with a standard IDE experience, available anywhere and anytime.
  * Have an all-in-one platform for developing, testing and debugging.

* **Simplify Operation** with minimal required IT TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), by:
  * Simplifying the creation, the deployments and upgrades of Fabric environments.
  * Providing high resilience and robustness.
  * Providing auto-scaling workloads.
  * Supporting hybrid cloud.
  * Providing rich observability and monitoring dashboards.

* **Empower Security** with a Zero Trust strategy implementation:
  * Enforce access control & privilege management for any environment.
  * Apply end-to-end access governance control and monitoring.
  * Have a Built-in SSO capabilities with a federated customerâ€™s IdP.
  * Built on CyberArk, which is a FedRAMP authorized and a leader in Identity Security and Access Management.
  * Avoid the need for any installations on the user's PC.
  * Zero Trust by design, K2view does not have any access to the Fabric runtime environments.



## K2cloud Deployment Types

K2view allows you to manage various deployment types (fully managed, self-hosted, hybrid) on various cloud providers (GCP, AWS, Azure) that provide Kubernetes infra.

* **Fully Managed** - K2view cloud-hosted, for a fully managed and automated experience, where data access is completely secured. A separate account is created on behalf each customer, in the cloud provider, ensuring a full and separated setup. 
* **Self-Hosted** - prevents data from leaving your environment by having Fabric deployed either in your cloud tenant or on-premises, thus meeting the strictest data movement requirements.
* **Hybrid** - controls when and how data moves from your on-premise environment to the cloud, efficiently and securely.

For all types of deployments - fully managed, self-hosted and hybrid - K2view uses a uniform way for building the infra, for the environment's functionality and for the project's lifecycle management.
