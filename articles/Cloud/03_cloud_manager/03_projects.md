# Projects

A **Project** is one of three parameters outlined in a Cloud Space. It is composed of some parts and it describes 2 important and diverse factors - the location of a Fabric Project on GIT and the Profiles connected to a Project. The Projectâ€™s definitions are the basis for Spaces creation and a Space contains at least 3 main fields that derive from the Project.
