# Task - Target Component

The Target component contains the target environment settings. The Target environment must be set for the following tasks: 

- Loading and/or deleting data to/from the target testing environment.
- [Entity reservation](/articles/TDM/tdm_architecture/08_entity_reservation.md) - reserving entities for the user in the target testing environment.
- AI training task - train the AI with a subset of entities for a [synthetic AI-based entities' generation](14e_task_source_ai_based_generation.md). 

When clicking the Target component, the Target form is opened.

A different Target form is displayed based on the task's data type:

- [Business entities](14b_task_source_component_entities.md#business-entity) with or without the referential data (related tables) - the entities can be extracted from the source environment or synthetically generated by the task.
- [Tables only](14c_task_source_component_tables.md).  

Click the Clear form to reset the form if needed.
