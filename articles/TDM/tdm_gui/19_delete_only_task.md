# TDM Delete Task

A Delete task only contains the **Delete** task type and deletes (cleans) the selected entities from the target environment. The delete task also releases the cleaned entities if the entity is reserved.

Note that the deleted flows must be implemented in the Fabric implementation. 

Click for more information about the [delete implementation](/articles/TDM/tdm_implementation/08_tdm_implement_delete_of_entities.md).

A Delete task contains the following tabs:

- [General](14a_task_general_tab.md)
- [Additional Execution Parameters](#additional-execution-parameters-tab)
- [Requested Entities](#requested-entities-tab)
- [Task Scheduling](22_task_execution_timing_tab.md)

When checking the **Set Task Variables** setting, a new [Task Variables](23_task_globals_tab.md) tab opens.

## Additional Execution Parameters Tab

The following execution parameters are set on **Delete tasks**:

### Post Execution Processes

## Requested Entities Tab

This tab defines the subset of entities for the task:

The following selection methods are available on load tasks: 

### Entity list 

This is the **default option**. Populate the list of entities for the task, separating them with a comma.  Note that a warning is given if the entity list has entities that are reserved for another user.

### Custom Logic

Select a Broadway flow to get the entity list for the task and set the maximum number of entities for the task:![custom logic](images/delete_task_requested_entities_custom_logic.png)

TDM 7.5 supports the creation of external input parameters on a Custom Logic Flow. In this case, the TDM GUI displays the input parameters in the task window, enabling the user to send values for these parameters. See example:

Note:

- It is possible to set an array value in a Custom Logic's parameter. For example: {1,2,3}, {"Open", "Close"}.
