# TDM Task Overview

Data provisioning and entity reservation are implemented by creating and executing TDM tasks. 

A TDM task is created in the TDM GUI. It holds a list of instructions and settings that define the type and subset of processed entities, the source and target environments and additional information. For example, create a task to copy 5 customers with small and medium business plans from Production into the UAT1 target environment.

The actual data provisioning and/or entity reservation is performed by the task execution where each task can be executed multiple times.

## Task Types

The following task types are supported by TDM:

- **Extract**, extracts the selected entities and/or Reference tables from the selected source environment and saves this data in Fabric for later use.
- **Load**,  provisions  the selected entities and/or Reference tables to the selected target environment.
- **Delete**, deletes the selected entities from the target environment.
- **Reserve**, reserves the selected entities in the target environment.

A TDM task can have a combination of multiple task types.

The following table describe the valid combinations of task types on a TDM task:

## Who Can Create a Task?
-  Admin users.
-  Environment owners can create a TDM task for their environment.
-  Testers who can create a TDM task for the environments they are attached to by a [TDM Environment Permission Set](10_environment_roles_tab.md):
   - Source environment, testers must be attached to the source environment by a permission set with [Read](10_environment_roles_tab.md#read-and-write-and-number-of-entities) access.
   - Target environment, testers must be attached to the target environment by a permission set with [Write](10_environment_roles_tab.md#read-and-write-and-number-of-entities) access.

- ![task icon](images/execute_task_icon.png)[Execute Task](26_task_execution.md). 
- ![task icon](images/hold_task_icon.png) [Hold Task](26_task_execution.md#holding-task-execution), set the task on-hold temporarily.
- ![task icon](images/save_as_icon.png) Save As, copy the task into a new task.
- ![task icon](images/task_execution_history_icon.png)[Task Execution History](27_task_execution_history.md), display the execution history of the selected task.



## How Do I Create or Edit a Task?

1. Click **New Task** in the right corner of the Tasks List window.
