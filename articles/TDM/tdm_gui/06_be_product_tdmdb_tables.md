# Business Entities and Systems - TDM DB Tables

TDM settings are saved in the [TDM PostgreSQL DB](/articles/TDM/tdm_architecture/02_tdm_database.md). 

Business Entity (BE) and System definitions **update the following TDM DB tables:**

### Business_Entities

This tables holds all [BEs](04_tdm_gui_business_entity_window.md) defined in the TDM GUI. 

-  A new record is created for each BE. 
-  Each BE is created in **Active** status and gets a unique **be_id** sequence which is the table's PK.

- Deleted BEs have an **Inactive** status and are not physically deleted from this table.

Note that to prevent creating several active BEs with the same name, the **be_name** column has a **unique index** when the status is **Active**.

### Products

This table holds all [systems (products)](05_tdm_gui_product_window.md) defined in the TDM GUI.
-  A new record is created for each system.  
-  Each system (product) is created in **Active** status and gets a unique **product_id** sequence which is the table's PK. 
-  **Deleted systems** have an **Inactive** status and are not physically deleted from this table.

Note that to prevent creating several active systems with the same name, the **product_name** column has a **unique index** when the status is **Active**. 

### Product_Logical_Units

This table holds the links between a BE, LU and a system (product), as follows:
- Links between LUs and a [BE](04_tdm_gui_business_entity_window.md).
- Links between parent-child LU relationships in a BE.
- Links between a BE and its LUs to a system (product). Each BE and LU combination can be attached to a [system](05_tdm_gui_product_window.md).

Adding an LU to a BE creates a new record in this table. Each record is marked with a unique **lu_id** sequence which is the table's PK. The table contains the following information:

- **LU information** - lu_id, lu_name, lu_description and lu_dc_name columns. 
- **BE information** - be_id column. This is the link to the **business_entities** table.
- **LU relationship in the BE** - lu_parent_id and lu_parent_name columns holding the ID and name of the [parent LU](/articles/TDM/tdm_overview/03_business_entity_overview.md#building-an-lu-hierarchy-in-a-be) if it exists. 
- **System (product) information** - product_id and product_name columns. The product_id links to the **Products** table.  The product_id and product_name columns are set to -1 and NULL default values when the record is created. System Information settings are defined when an LU is attached to a system. If the LU is deleted from a system, the system information's columns return to their default values.

### TDM_BE_Post_Exe_Process

This table holds a list of [Post-Execution Processes](/articles/TDM/tdm_gui/04_tdm_gui_business_entity_window.md#post-execution-processes-tab) attached to each BE. A separate record is created for each post-execution process. Each record is marked with a unique **process_id** sequence which is the table's PK.

The following information is stored in this table:

- **Process Information** -  process_id, process_name, process_description and execution_order columns.
- **BE information** -  be_id column that links to the **business_entities** table.
