The batch process initiates a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/Academy_6.5_TDM_7.4/articles/14_sync_LU_instance/01_sync_LUI_overview.md">Sync</a>&nbsp;of the selected entities into Fabric.</li>

<h4>Data Versioning</h4>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="600pxl">
<p>Data Versioning enables users to keep versions (backups) of data during functional tests and restore the latest saved version of the data when needed. Users can create an Extract task to create a version of the data and save it in Fabric. To get the extracted version in the testing environment, the tester can create a load task, select the required version and re-load the selected version of the data to the environment instead of the corrupted data.</p>

<h4>Entity Reservation</h4>
</td>
<td>
<p>The Entity Reservation feature is made to enable a user to reserve (lock) entities in the testing environment and prevent other users from re-provisioning these entities into the testing environment until the user completes the functional tests and can release these entities.</p>
