# What is the Test Data Management (TDM) Platform? 

<a href="https://www.k2view.com/products/test-data-management/" target="_blank">Test Data Management (TDM)</a> offers an automated solution for provisioning subsets of Business Entities (Digital Entities) like Customer, Order, Patient, Product or Household from source systems into selected testing environments to provide real, high-quality data to testing teams.

While enterprise IT continues to adopt DevOps to accelerate delivery of solutions to both internal and external customers, one thing still holds them back - provisioning realistic data to test these solutions in a timely manner. With increasing complexity and system interdependencies, testing budgets now consume a large portion of all IT resources, and yet the time required for testing brings the agility of DevOps to a halt.

One of the main challenges of providing real data to testing teams is that data is often split between different data sources. For example, a Customer may be broken up between Customer Care, Billing, Ordering, Ticketing, and Collection systems. To run functional tests on a Customer in an integrative testing environment, their data must be extracted from all relevant source systems.

The K2View patented [Digital Entity](/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md#digital-entity) based [MicroDB](/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md#mdb--microdb), a data lake for each Digital Entity instance, ensures smooth data provisioning, based on the company's business needs rather than running a separate copy on each data source.

### Key TDM Features

- Built-in self-service web application where testers can request data to be provisioned on-demand and in real-time. 
- Central storage of provisioned entities in Fabric.
- Copying data into live testing environments. 
- Partial data requests, re-deployment of data and data appending: 
  - Provisioning predefined lists of Business Entities from a selected source environment to a selected target environment. All data related to the selected entities is extracted and copied to the relevant data systems.
  - Copying a sub-set of entities based on predefined parameters. For example, copying 10 customers in NY and using small business packages.
- Entity clone, cloning a given entity into the target environment. TDM replaces the sequences of each clone to avoid sequence duplication.
- Replacement of sequences of provisioned entities to avoid duplication in the target DB. 
- Entity reservation, enable the user to reserve entities in the testing environment and avoid other users to delete or reload these entities in the environment until the user completes their functional testing on these entities.
- Automatic data security and masking on an entity-by-entity basis.
- Support for up-to-date data of the selected entities.
- Cross-application integrity.
- Data Versioning features:
  - Users can save (extract) specific versions of a selected list of entities or selected list of metadata (reference) tables.
  - Users can load a selected version of entities or metadata tables to the selected target environment.
-  Provisioning of data on-demand or automatic provisioning based on scheduling parameters. For example, provisioning the data automatically every week.
