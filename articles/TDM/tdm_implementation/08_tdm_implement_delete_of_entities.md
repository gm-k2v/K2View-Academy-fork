# TDM - Deleting Entities

Every LU must include the ability to Delete Entities from a target environment to support the following tasks:

- [Load and Delete task](/articles/TDM/tdm_gui/14_task_overview.md#task-types), the entities are deleted and reloaded to the target environment.
- [Delete task](/articles/TDM/tdm_gui/19_delete_only_task.md), the entities are deleted (cleaned) from the task's environment.
- [Data Versioning](/articles/TDM/tdm_gui/15_data_flux_task.md/articles/TDM/tdm_gui/18_load_task_data_versioning_mode.md) load task, the entities are deleted and reloaded to the target environment.

Note that if there is no need to support a delete of entities or Data Versioning load tasks, the target tables do not need to be added to the LUs.

## LU Structure - Target Tables

Each LU has two main branches that are linked to the **FABRIC_TDM_ROOT** root table:

- **Source branch**, LU tables that extract an entity's source data. Source LU tables are populated except for [delete only tasks](/articles/TDM/tdm_gui/19_delete_only_task.md) where no data is extracted from the data sources.
- **Target branch**, LU tables that extract the target keys of an entity. The keys are extracted from the **target environment** when the task needs to delete the entities from the target environment.

The target table contains the list of target IDs (keys) required to delete the data of the selected entities from the target environment and populate [TDM_LU_TYPE_REL_TAR_EID](06_tdm_implementation_support_hierarchy.md#tdm_lu_type_rel_tar_eid) with the target children IDs. It is recommended to add the **TAR_** prefix to each target table. 

TDM 8.1 added an automatic generation of the target tables and their population flow:

### Target Tables Generation

1. Open the Shared Globals and verify that **TDM_DELETE_TABLES_PREFIX** Global is defined (the default is  TAR_). This is the prefix of the target LU tables.

2. Verify that the **ROOT_TABLE_NAME** LU's Global is set. 

3. Complete the adding of all source LU tables to the LU schema and deploy the LU to the debug server.

4. Open the **createDeleteTablesAndPopulations** flow (imported from the TDM library) and set the input parameters:

   - **LU name**
   - **Override Existing Flows** - when set to **true**, the flow deletes and recreates existing population flows for the target tables. When set to **false**, the flow skips existing flows and creates new flows only, if needed. The **default** value is **false**.
   - **Target Interface**
   - **Target Schema**

   Run the flow.  The flow creates the target tables, their population flows, and add them to the LU schema. 

5. Open LUâ€™s schema, right click > Automatic Layout to view the added target tables.

   

#### Adding a Decision Function to the Target LU Tables

The target LU tables must be populated when running a TDM task that deletes the entities from the target environment. The target keys must be extracted from the target environment to enable deleting entities and their related data.

If the task does not delete the entities from the target environment, the target keys do not need to be extracted from the target environment.

The Broadway [InitiateTDMLoad](10_tdm_generic_broadway_flows.md#initialization) flow sets the **TDM_DELETE_BEFORE_LOAD** Global to **true** if the task must **delete the entities** from the target. Otherwise, this Global is set to **false**.   

The **fnDecisionDeleteFromTarget** [Decision function](/articles/14_sync_LU_instance/05_sync_decision_functions.md) (imported from the [TDM Library](04_fabric_tdm_library.md) ) is **automatically added to all target tables** by the target tables generation flow. 

#### Populating Target Tables with the Target Environment

The LUI sync can populate the branches, source and target when running a load task that requires both delete and load entity operations. 

The **source LU tables** must extract the data from the **source environment**, where the **target LU tables** must extract the data from the **target environment**.

The Broadway [InitiateTDMLoad](10_tdm_generic_broadway_flows.md#initialization) flow sets the active environment to the source environment before synching the LUI into Fabric.

The **setTargetEnv_Actor** is **automatically added to the generated population flow of the main target LU table **by the target tables generation flow.  This actor sets the active environment based on the **TDM_TARGET_ENV_NAME** key (set by the **InitiateTDMLoad** flow with on the task's target environment).

For example:

Note that the populations of the target tables can be based on **the same interfaces as the source LU tables**, but the connection details change to the target environment, since the population of the main target LU table sets the target environment to be the active environment.

## Adding Broadway Flows to Delete the Entities

Add Delete Broadway flows to delete the entities from the target environment based on the target LU tables.
