# Create New Environment

An environment is defined in Fabric using the following steps:

* Creating the environment in the Fabric Studio using the **Environments List** grid.
* Populating the connection details of the interfaces via the **Selected Environment** grid.
* Deploying all the environments to the server while defining the active environment.

### Step 1 - Creating the Environment

1. Go to **Project Tree** > **Shared Objects** and double click **Environments** to open the Environments window.

2. In the **Environments List** grid, do the following:

   -  Enter a meaningful name for the environment in the **Name** field.

    - (Optional) In the **Comments** field add a description of the environment.

    - (Optional) In the **Fabric URL** field, select the server from the predefined list in the **Server Configuration** tab in the [**User Preferences**](/articles/04_fabric_studio/04_user_preferences.md) window. 

       The selected Fabric node is used to encrypt the passwords of all interfaces related to the given environment and to run the test connection. If the node is not selected, Fabric uses the local test connection and previous encryption algorithm.

   -  Click **Re-Key** to use the most updated encryption mechanism and the latest master key to encrypt the passwords of the interfaces.

### Step 2 - Defining Interface Settings per Environment 

Once **Name** in the **Environments List** grid is clicked, all DB and non-DB interfaces in the project are copied to the **Selected Environment** grid and displayed in the tabs. Each interface type is displayed in a dedicated tab. For example, if the project has DB, SMTP, Kafka and HTTP interfaces, each type is displayed in a separate tab.

By default, all interfaces are enabled whereby the settings of each relevant interface can be disabled if it is not applicable for the environment.

1. Select the interface and enable or disable it to add it to the environment or to remove it from the environment by either:
   * Clicking the **Enabled** column.
   * Right clicking the row and clicking **Set Selected Rows as Enabled** or **Set Selected Rows as Disabled**. Hold the **Ctrl** key to select multiple rows. 
2. Populate the relevant fields of each active interface in the  **Selected Environment** grid: server, user, password, etc. If the project has several interface types, go through the tabs and populate all mandatory fields.
   * Note that when the password is updated, the Fabric Studio re-encrypts it.

### Step 3 - Deploying the Environments

Repeat steps 1 and 2 to create the required environments and then do the following:

1. Save the environments definitions:

   * The environment cannot be saved when ![image](images/25_red_sign.PNG) is displayed to indicate that a mandatory field is not populated.

   * If the mandatory settings are missing, the validation error message popups up:

2. Click **Deploy** to deploy an environment to the Fabric server. Unlike the interfaces, the environments are not deployed together with an LUT, Reference tables and Web Services and require an explicit deployment.

   Note that environments can be deployed to the Fabric Server either by the [Fabric Studio](03_deploy_env_from_Fabric_Studio.md) or by using a command line to perform an [offline deployment](04_offline_deployment.md) from an XML file.
