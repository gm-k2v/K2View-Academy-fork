# CommonDB Configuration 

All configuration parameters are located in the *common_area_config* section of the config.ini file located in the *Fabric Home directory* of each Fabric Node.


### Update Size
The allowed size of an update message can be configured using the UPDATE_SIZE and SNAPSHOT_SIZE parameters in the *common_area_memory_queues_config* section.

On Kafka:
```
# Memory queue size for update - e.g. 10 MB
UPDATE_SIZE=10000
```

```
# Memory queue size for snapshot
#SNAPSHOT_SIZE=100
```

### Update Distribution
Fabric allows users to use server's RAM to distribute messages (in a single-node configuration only) in order to avoid the need for Kafka configurations. It is very important to note that in that case, overall data persistency cannot be ensured.

```
# Messages distribution mode - MEMORY / KAFKA
MESSAGES_BROKER_TYPE=MEMORY
```

Internal distribution of long snapshot / transaction:

~~~
MESSAGES_INTERNAL_BROKER_TYPE=PUB_SUB
~~~

### Message Access Retry

When a message is not processed properly, Fabric allows for a configurable number of retrials to be executed.
```
# Max retry for a poisoned message
PROCESS_UPDATE_MESSAGE_RETRIES_COUNT=3
```

### Snapshot Idle Time

```
# Max idle time when consuming snapshot messages, if processing hangs on longer the consumer will return IDLE_TIMOUT
# 16.6 hrs
CONSUMER_IDLE_TIME=60000
```

### Max Retry for Common Area Operation
```OPERATION_RETRIES_COUNT=3```

### Affinity 

Using the [affinity](/articles/20_jobs_and_batch_services/10_jobs_and_batches_affinity.md) parameter, the table synchronization process can be allocated to a specific node (by default, no affinity is set).

```
SYNC_JOBS_AFFINITY=10.23.10.11
```

### Drop Topics

When set to true, all topics for tables being dropped will be removed automatically:

```
DELETE_TOPICS_ON_DROP=true
```

### Bulk Size

If 2500 insert commands are required, each bulk of 1000 commands is sent to Kafka, while the update content is kept in Cassandra. 
These 2500 inserts are divided into 3 transactions, the first 2 containing 1000 rows to insert, and the third one 500.

```
TRANSACTION_BULK_SIZE=1000
```


### Maximum Transactions in Bulk

```
MAX_TRANSACTIONS_COMMIT=100
```


### Memory Queue Size for Snapshot
```
# defines maximum snapshot size - in the case below set to 100 MB
#SNAPSHOT_SIZE=100
```

### Snapshot Table TTL

```
# in seconds - Default is one week
# below has been set to one day
COMMONS_TABLE_TTL=86400 
```



## CommonDB Kafka Configuration Settings

All the Kafka connection settings are defined in the **[default_pubsub]** section of the config.ini and are applicable across various Fabric processes including the Common DB connection to Kafka.

When it is required to have different Kafka settings for Common DB, it can be done using the **[common_area_pubsub]** section. This section does not have to include all the parameters, but only those which should override the default section's settings.

## System DB Snapshots Settings

### Long snapshot / transactions table name
```
COMMONS_SNAP_TABLE=snapshots
```

### Entry TTL 
```
Snapshot table TTL in seconds - Default is one week
#COMMONS_TABLE_TTL=8640
```

### TIMEOUT

Maximum idle time when consuming snapshot messages
```
CASSANDRA_WAIT_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT=60000
```
