Customer is requested to subscribe to the K2view Support Site to be notified as aforementioned, and to have access to other services provided via the K2view Support Site, like Q&A’s about K2view Software and its use. It is Customer’s responsibility to verify that the new update or release conforms with the implementation or application using the K2view Software. Upon Customer’s request and K2view’s written agreement, K2view may assist in the verification effort or provide other on-site assistance subject to availability, at K2view’s then current rates.


**1.3.** Maintenance for Supported Versions - K2view shall provide Maintenance & Support for Version Releases for at least two years (commencing on the Major Version release date, for the Major Version used by the Customer, “Major Version X”) and at least while the Major Version lasts, subject to having a Software License Agreement in term.

### 2. **PROBLEM REPORTING SYSTEMS** 
**2\.1.** K2view shall provide Customer with access to K2view’s online ticketing system for reporting Errors (“Create ticket”), available on K2view Support Site under the “Got a problem?” section.


**2\.2.** K2view shall provide Customer 24/7 hotline phone number for reporting Critical and High Errors in production.

**2\.3.** Errors will be submitted according to the following definition of content and severity. Each Error should report only one problem at a time to ensure separate tracking of unrelated problems. The Error should include  the following information, at least: Company name, Project name, Product name, K2view Software Version, Environment details, Type of Error, Priority, Detailed description of the problem.

If requested by K2view and reasonably required to resolve any Error, Customer shall provide the following information:

**2\.4.** The Error severity level represents the impact of the problem on Customer's environments. In submitting the Error, Customer shall provide the reason for its evaluation of the severity level in the description of the problem. The Error severity shall be agreed in good faith between Customer and K2view and the severity levels shall be defined as follows: 

- **Critical Error** is a flaw adhering one or more of the following conditions:
  - It results in a total failure of the K2view Software or Customer Systems.

It creates a situation that does not enable at least one substantial feature of the K2view Software. 

- **High Error** is, other than any Critical Error, a flaw adhering one of more of the following conditions:

  - It impairs the systems that the Customer’s end users interact with severely or its material functionality.
  - It creates a substantial flaw in the Customer’s ability to provide services using the K2view Software.
  - It causes a system restart that impairs the K2view Software or the operation of certain features of the K2view Software, more than once a day.
  - It is likely to cause delays in the K2view Software deployment.


- **Low Error** is, other than any Critical Error or High Error, any minor flaw in the K2view Software.


**2\.5.** Customer shall: (a) before forwarding an Error to K2view, check that it is not a duplicate; (b) provide K2view with the standard Error issue content information as defined in Section 3.3 as well as other information and/or test data, so that K2view is able to reproduce the problem at K2view’s facilities. If K2view is unable to reproduce the problem, or the solution involves modifying internal K2view Software’s configuration parameters, K2view may request permission for a support staff member or K2view developer to enter a WebEx or similar connection, so that K2view personnel view the user’s computer screen. A request for a remote connection will come only after other options are explored.

**2\.6.** K2view will provide a response to Errors according to time frames as a function of the severity level, type of environment (production, development, test, certification/UAT) and, according to the level of service ordered as per the applicable schedule (Standard, Silver, Gold), as further detailed in the tables below. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties hereto, if an Error arrives outside of K2view’s normal business hours, the response time frame will begin at the start of the next business day, except Critical Errors, which will be handled continuously in any given day. A response time frame begins when an Error with reproducible results has been acknowledged by K2view. If insufficient information to reproduce the results is received, K2view will notify Customer, and the status of the Error will be shown as “waiting for customer” until additional information is received. Tickets opened for non-product issues may be re-allocated as Concierge Consulting tickets when relevant.
